# PCTYTakeHome

### Bug reports can be found in the bugReport directory.

### Note: Some tests are failing because I'm not entirely sure if the status code returned is what is expected. These would be things I'd bring up with the developers in order to see what status code we think is best.

### To run the tests
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npx playwright install`
4. Copy the `.env` template below and place in `PCTYTakeHome/`.
5. `npm run test` will run all tests.
